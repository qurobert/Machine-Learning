### 42_ml_modules ###
One week to learn basics in Machine Learning! ðŸ¤–  This project is a Machine Learning bootcamp created by 42 AI. #

Forewords: The subjects were made by 42AI and are now a part of the 42 curriculum thanks to the hard work of authors.

## Module 00: Stepping Into Machine Learning ##
Get started with some linear algebra and statistics

Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations. Hypothesis, model, regression, cost function.

## Module02 - Univariate Linear Regression
Implement a method to improve your model's performance: gradient descent, and discover the notion of normalization

Gradient descent, linear regression, normalization.

## Module02 - Multivariate Linear Regression
Extend the linear regression to handle more than one features, build polynomial models and detect overfitting.

Multivariate linear hypothesis, multivariate linear gradient descent, polynomial models. Training and test sets, overfitting.

## Module03 - Logistic Regression
Discover your first classification algorithm: logistic regression!

Logistic hypothesis, logistic gradient descent, logistic regression, multiclass classification. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

## Module04 - Regularization
Fight overfitting!

Regularization, overfitting. Regularized cost function, regularized gradient descent. Regularized linear regression. Regularized logistic regression.
